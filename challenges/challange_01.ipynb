        "# Design of four-qubit cluster states\n",
        "In quantum information and computing, a cluster state refers to a highly entangled multi-qubit state. These states are typically generated on a lattice of qubits through Ising-type interactions. Alternatively, cluster states can be viewed as a special case of graph states, where the underlying graph corresponds to a connected subset of a d-dimensional lattice. Cluster states play a central role in one-way (measurement-based) quantum computation.\n",

        "In this challenge, your task is to design a four-qubit cluster state similar to the one introduced in [Workshop (1) solutions here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TUmX1xVGYip2wn0-tCB4uXRlxSbeI4me?usp=sharing).\n",
