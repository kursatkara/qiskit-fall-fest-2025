# Code of Conduct

Our goal is a friendly, safe, and focused space to learn Qiskit together.

**Scope:** This applies to all event spaces and interactions: Microsoft Teams meetings, breakout rooms, chat/DMs, and shared files.

---

## TL;DR
- Keep your **mic muted** unless called on.
- Ask questions in **chat**; the presenter will reply when able, and **organizers** will help in chat.
- Be **kind**, professional, and stay **on topic**.
- No harassment, spam, or unauthorized recording/sharing.

---

## During Sessions (Microsoft Teams)
- Stay **muted** during talks/demos; use **Raise Hand** when invited.
- Share your screen **only** if a host asks you to.
- Use a clear display name (e.g., *First Last, OSU*). Camera optional.

## Be Respectful
- Welcome beginners; assume good intent.
- Use clear, professional language.
- Keep messages concise; avoid flooding or repeated posts.
- Stay on topic (Qiskit/quantum and event content).

## Not Allowed
- Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, or personal attacks.
- Disruption.
- Malicious links; pirated or confidential material.
- Unrelated advertising/soliciting.
- Recording or sharing othersâ€™ content without permission.

## Q&A and Chat
- Post questions in **chat**. Include brief context (e.g., notebook cell or error line).
- One question per message helps others follow.
- Long troubleshooting may be moved by organizers to a help room/channel.

## Privacy & Recording
- We will announce if **recording** is on. Chat may be part of the archive.

## Accessibility
- If you need accommodations (captions, pacing, materials), contact organizers in advance. We will make a good-faith effort to help.

## Enforcement
- Organizers may warn, mute, disable chat/screen share, move to lobby, or remove participants.
- Serious or repeated issues may lead to removal from this and future events.
